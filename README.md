Hi I am Jacqueline! 

Iâ€™m a software engineer and creative who recently switched from the tactile to the digital world!  As a software engineer I optimize creativity and technical design to create effective, efficient and user-friendly experiences. 

 What do I love most about being a software engineer? The endless learning! The continual room for growth and skill-based learning reminds me everyday why I love what I do!
